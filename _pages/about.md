Hello! I am an early career scientist working in the domain of climate and geophysical variability since the past 6+ years. 

My PhD research focused on quantifying extreme variability and intermittency of geophysical fields in real and simulated environments, deriving focus from 3 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - climate action, sustainable cities and communities, and affordable and clean energy. For this, the symmetries of governing Navier-Stokes equations were statistically reproduced using multiplicative cascades and thus characterizing their scale invariant properties using multifractal tools (Universal Multifractals or UM). Towards this, time series of following fields were studied individualy and jointly with each other: rainfall, kinetic energy, extinction coefficient, wind, wind power, temperature, pressure, air density and relative humidity.

My latest assignment was postdoctoral research at CEREA/HM&Co. laboratories of École nationale des ponts et chaussées (ENPC), where I worked on scaling and below cloud scavenging of aerosols with rainfall. Before PhD, I worked with Govt of India project of CAIPEEX on aerosol cloud interactions in Western Ghats through flight campaigns and insitu measurements.

My current, and previous roles, involves/d skills in data analysis, numerical simulations, scientific writing and reviewing, as well as mentorship and dissemination with peers and public. I serve as a peer reviewer in four journals: Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (EGU Copernicus), Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (Wiley), Hydrological Sciences journal (Taylor & Francis) and Chaos (AIP). I also volunteer as a writer for PARI (People Archive of Rural India) library for delivering facts and factoids on scientific and policy related reports.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, hiking, skating, badmintion and traveling among many other things. Cheers!
